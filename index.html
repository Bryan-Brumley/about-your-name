<h1>About Your Name</h1>


<p>I have a large German Shepherd. She is a hand full and has a ton of energy. She could use quite a bit more
        training but she is over all a great dog.</p>
    
<p>I am a dapper gentleman. I like to eat British baked goods. I only enjoy the finest things in life, like gourmet Italian pasta.</p>

<ul>
    <li>This is a list item. One thing about me is that I am a massive fan of lists. They're gorgeous.</li>
    <li>My favorite type of pizza is PEPPERONI HOTDOG.</li>
    <li>I have 23 dogs. I live in an animal shelter.</li>
    <li>Despite my current living conditions, I maintain a very high standard of living.</li>
    <li>The dogs are my personal servants.</li>
</ul>

<p> A fact about me is that I really like spaghetti. That is not the most interesting fact but that is all I could think
of.</p>
